Week 4 Homework - Star Wars RPG

I started this one first but in the end I couldn't get it to work 100%. The mechanics of the game are all perfect I just had trouble with appending the characters to the appropriate div. I figured I would submit it anyway beacuse I spent so much time on it. The Crystal Collector is my offical submission for homework 4 though!
